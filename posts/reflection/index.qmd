A recap of all mini projects from the semester.

# 1
In this project we simulated the sampling distributions of sample minimums and maximums from different populations.


##how each mini-project ties in to other content in the course.

1. tying standard error into variance of prior/posterior distributions
1. test statistics in general (ex. for CI)
1. did a lot of simulations in the course
2. likelihood ratios
2. random variables?
3. more simulation 
3. credible intervals for hypothesis 
4. means like when we look at expectation??
4. still trying to model distributions, just different framework

##how each mini-project ties in with some other mini-projects (note that some mini-projects are more connected than others: you do not need to “connect” every single mini-project with every other mini-project).

1. confidence interval simulations
2. project 5, writing meaningfully (using words correctly in context)
3. looking at properties for different n, like in project 1 we had different dist
3. credible intervals, project 4
4. 



##your biggest take-aways from these mini-projects (these should not be copy-pasted from the “take-away” section of any of your original mini-projects: the expectation is that, now that we have gone through the entire course, your take-aways may be more sophisticated now).

1. patterns (ex. symmetrical distribution SE)
2. a lot of things are related ()
3. importance of not violating assumptions
4. personal bias in creating priors????
5. it is important to be intentional and thoughtful with data analysis.

In general: power of simulation
There are practical applications of stuff that seems very math based and theoretical
