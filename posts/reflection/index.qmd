A recap of all mini projects from the semester.

# 1
In this project we simulated the sampling distributions of sample minimums and maximums from different populations.


##how each mini-project ties in to other content in the course.

1. tying standard error into variance of prior/posterior distributions
1. test statistics in general (ex. for CI)
1. did a lot of simulations in the course
2. likelihood ratios
2. random variables?

##how each mini-project ties in with some other mini-projects (note that some mini-projects are more connected than others: you do not need to “connect” every single mini-project with every other mini-project).

1. confidence interval simulations
2. project 5, writing meaningfully (using words correctly in context)



##your biggest take-aways from these mini-projects (these should not be copy-pasted from the “take-away” section of any of your original mini-projects: the expectation is that, now that we have gone through the entire course, your take-aways may be more sophisticated now).

1. patterns (ex. symmetrical distribution SE)
2. a lot of things are related ()

In general: power of simulation
There are practical applications of stuff that seems very math based and theoretical
